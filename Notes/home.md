# Project Description
The Good Stuff site is an indexing service for Judeo-Christian churches that would love to get their message out to the public more effectively. We are not burdened by teachings being topical or historical, as long as they bring the reader, listener, watcher, back to God Almighty, so that they can receive His blessings without being tripped up by the darkness of this world.

# Roadmap
1. Project 1 - Self registration of users, and churches, so that we know what to index, and who to contact if we discover a problem connecting to their site.
2. Project 2 - Index member churches media content, and index it into both time and topic content on the site. Clicking on the index result will bring the user to the proper page of the content on the content creator's site.
3. Project 3 - To be determined by the success of 1 and 2.

# Technology
The site is planned to be built on a .NET Core 3.x or higher framework. This includes both a C# backend and a Blazor C# front End. The benefit of using Blazor, is that we can mix technologies between C# and JavaScript on the frontend. We have a strong propensity for Angular over React, due to all of the technical problems with the site of the company who created React.

We are expected the site to work just as well on mobile devices as it does on desktops. This includes supporting Web Assembly projects.
