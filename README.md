# The Good Stuff Site

## The core of TheGoodStuff.church website.

Welcome to your community to reach people with Godâ€™s message,

The Good Stuff Church is not a church in the traditional sense, but a clearinghouse for the
good news, and the good message of God, by the local churches and bible study groups in
the greater Evansville, Vanderburgh area (EVV), to get the message of God out to the
people, in a collaborative way.

## What does this mean?
* You do what you have always done, and we add a new venue to get the message out.
* We do not want to burden you with any more work, but we want to get your message out
to those who need it, even if they don't know it yet.

## How do we do this?
* After our site is live, if you have a Youtube channel or other streaming service, such as
Facebook, Zoom, Twitch, we will watch for your updates and link them in 24 to 48 hours.
The site says Under Construction. When will it be live?
* We have a Go-Live date planned for January 1st. However, we are looking for our first
five organizations that would allow us to promote their content, and direct people to their
sites.
* Until that date, those that join us early will get preview privilege, so that they may provide
early feedback.

## How much will this cost us?
* Nothing. This is a group of people volunteering their time to promote growth in God's
word. We are out here to be gardeners for Christ Jesus, so that the churches may be the
evangelists reaping what has been sowed.

## Is this just for "Our" denomination?
* We are promoting the message of life from all Judeo-Christian organization.
* We do have some common-sense limits. We don't accept organizations that promote
violence or sin. But we do accept and encourage organizations that welcome sinners,
that they can see that the God of Abraham is their God too.

## Is this a prelude to opening a church?
* No, Our goal in the EVV area is to saturate this city with so much of God's good stuff that
there is no room for darkness in people's hearts.

## Is this the only thing that this service will do?

We do have an additional service roadmap that we will be implementing once our core
services are live.
* Event announcements
* Newsletters
* Contact / Q&Aforms
* Publishable FAQs
* Other services that assist the wonderful teachers of Christ promote in the greater EVV
area, but don't have the time or resources to manage themselves.

As our services prove their benefit, we will be opening the doors to a voluntary advisory
committee so that this organization's future is always out to promote the good news of God.
